Contributing Documentation

Contributions are certainly welcome and encouraged. 

This application is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages) 
meaning the `master` branch is what GitHub uses to deploy the application as found at https://mattw.io/youtube-geofind. 

Pull requests should generally describe the changes being made or the issue being addressed. 
Pull requests should be merged into the `develop` branch so that I may make any additional tweaks or adjustments before 
merging into `master` for GitHub Pages to deploy. 

Make the pull request from your own fork of the project. 
It is recommended to base it off the `develop` branch. 
However, depending how involved you would like to be, I can consider adding you to the main project if asked.
